# CASA0016 part of MSc CONNECTED ENVIRONMENTS
Water Quality Sensors

## Summary

For this piece of coursework, a water quality device was built. The end product uses sensors for pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen and conductivity. The results of the measurements are displayed on an LCD screen for the user. The devive uses an Arduino MKR 1310.

## Project Overview
The main objective initially was to have a deployable, standalone device that could sense and communicate current water quality. Due to time constraints, the scope was changed and a mobile device was built instead. Due to the initial direction being to deploy the device, some of the design decisions were driven by that and fitted around the later goal.
